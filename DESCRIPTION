GAMESS (General Atomic and Molecular Electronic Structure System)

This roll source supports building with different compilers.  By default, it
builds using the gnu compilers.  To build for a different configuration, use
the ROLLCOMPILER make variable, e.g.,

make ROLLCOMPILER=intel

The build process currently supports the values "intel" and "gnu" for the
ROLLCOMPILER variable, defaulting to "gnu".

If the ROLLCOMPILER variable is specified, its value is incorporated into the
names of the produced roll and rpms, e.g.,

make ROLLCOMPILER=intel

produces a roll with a name that begins "gamess-intel"; it contains and
installs a similarly-named rpm.

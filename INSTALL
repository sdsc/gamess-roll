This roll bundles the GAMESS quantum chemistry package.  To install, execute
these instructions on a Rocks development machine (e.g., a frontend), starting
in this directory:

% make
% rocks add roll *.iso
% rocks enable roll gamess
% cd /export/rocks/install
% rocks create distro
% rocks run roll gamess | bash

In addition to the software itself, the roll installs GAMESS environment module
files in /opt/modulefiles/applications/gamess.

This roll source supports building with different compilers.  By default, it
builds using the gnu compilers.  To build for a different configuration, use
the ROLLCOMPILER make variable, e.g.,

% make ROLLCOMPILER=intel

The build process currently supports the values "intel" and "gnu" for the
ROLLCOMPILER variable, defaulting to "gnu".

This roll also supports the ROLLOPTS make variable.  If it contains 'vsmp',
the gamess executable uses mpi for communication; otherwise, it uses sockets.
